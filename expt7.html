	<h1 id="a1"> E-Waste Management </h1>
	<p>
		In India, E-waste is becoming an important waste stream in terms of both quantity and toxicity (Wath et al., 2010). Managing the ever increasing volume of E-waste is a major concern for most of the countries today. The first major problem associated with E-waste management is its ever increasing quantum, and second is its scientific and environment friendly disposal, which is very crucial (Wath et al., 2010). In India, domestic E-waste is significant in addition to illegal imports (Sepúlveda et al., 2010). It is argued that due to low market penetration rate in the past, the stock of EEE already put on the market has not been as large as that in OECD countries and the market of most products is far from saturated (Ongondo, Williams and Cherrett, 2011). Due to these developments, countries like India face a fast increasing load of WEEE originating both inland and through illegal imports (Streicher-Porte et al., 2005).
		According to the MoEF (2008), the electronics industry has emerged as the fastest growing segment of Indian industry both in terms of production and exports. The report further states that the share of software services in electronics and IT sector has gone up from 38.7% in 1998-99 to 61.8%  in 2003-04. A review of the industry statistics show that in 1990-91, hardware accounted for nearly 50% of total IT revenues while software's share was 22%. The scenario changed by 1994-95, with hardware share falling to 38% and software's share rising to 41%. This shift in the IT industry began with liberalization and the subsequent opening up of Indian markets (MoEF, 2008). With the development of IT industries emerged the problems related to E-waste. Although, today, IT industries contribute the most significant share to the E-waste stream, consumer electronics also mark a major portion of it.
		Moreover, most of the businesses, banking sector, academic institutes etc rely heavily on EEE and thus, add end-of-life electronic gadgets to the existing waste stream.
		However, estimates of E-waste in India are unavailable, or at most hazy (Sinha, 2004). Skinner (2010) argued that of the estimated 382,979 tonnes of E-waste generated in India, 144,143 tonnes entered the waste stream in the year 2007. According to Streicher-Porte et al. (2005), although the per capita waste production in populous countries like China and India is still relatively small, these countries are already huge producers of E-waste or WEEE. Considering the growth rate, several studies stated that the volume of E-waste will reach nearly 0.7 million MT by 2015 and 2 million MT by 2025.
		Managing the increasing quantum of E-waste effectively and efficiently— both in terms of cost and environmental impact—is a complex task (Sinha-Khetriwal, Kraeuchi and Schwaninger, 2005). While some countries have organized systems for the collection, segregation, recycling, disposal and monitoring (as for example, Switzerland), other countries (mostly developing countries like India and China) are still to find a solution that ensures minimizing the negative environmental and human health impacts of E-waste treatment and recycling.

	<h1 id="a2"> Current practices in E-waste management in India </h1>
	<p>
		India, today, is burdened with the enormous volume of E-waste, generated domestically or imported illegally. Over the last few decades, India, along with other Asian and African countries, has become a major destination for E-waste exports from OECD countries. In addition, Indians have been generating rapidly increasing amounts of E-waste domestically (Skinner, 2010). It is estimated that 75% of electronic items are stored due to uncertainty of how to manage it (Ramachandra and Varghese, 2004). A pervasive view of E-waste as a commodity causes a reluctance to dispose of E-waste immediately (Sinha, 2008). The electronic junks lie unattended in houses, offices, warehouses etc. and normally mixed with household wastes, which are finally disposed off at landfills (Sinha, 2008). Hence in order to get rid of the electronic junks, implementation of proper management practices is of utmost significance.
		Moreover, India lacks a comprehensive regulation dealing with E-waste management (Skinner, 2010). Consequently, much of the domestic and imported WEEE end up in illegal dismantling and recycling facilities where workers use processes hazardous to both their health and the environment. Besides pollutions, backyard recycling also scores badly from the resource conservation and social point of views (Manomaivibool, 2009).
		Most E-waste is not recycled, because E-waste items tend to go out with household waste and receive no special treatment (Ladou and Lovegrove, 2008). Most E-waste is currently landfilled (Robinson, 2009). For emerging economies the material flows related to E-waste offer a business opportunity (Streicher-Porte et al., 2005). An entire new economic sector revolves around trading, repairing and regaining materials from redundant electronic devices (Streicher-Porte et al., 2005). The backlog demand of EEE in developing countries as well as the lack of national regulation and lax enforcement of existing laws promotes the growth of a semi-formal or informal economy. It provides a living for the urban and rural poor, but causes severe risks for humans and the local environment. For some of the densely populated regions poorly controlled WEEE recycling with extremely risky techniques is a grim reality. Most of the participants in this sector are not aware of the risks, do not know of better practices or simply have no access to investment capital to finance profitable improvements.

	<h1 id="a3"> E-waste Recycling Practices in India </h1>
	<p>
		Recycling is a very lucrative business in India and dominated with informal actors (Manomaivibool, 2009). The “E-waste” recycling sector in many parts of Asia remains largely unregulated (Greenpeace, 2005) and India is no exception to it. This is due to values in some types of used products, mainly metal-based products and those with PWBs, and low labour costs (Manomaivibool, 2009). Moreover, the sector is poorly studied with regard to its impacts on the environment and on the health of recycling workers and surrounding communities. In the context of India, the E-waste recycling sector could be divided into Nonformal or Informal and Formal sectors.

	<h1 id="a4"> Informal or Non-Formal Sector </h1>
	<p>
		The uncontrolled recycling of E-waste by the so called informal sector is the main concern in Non-OECD countries like India, China, etc (Wath, et al., 2010). In most of the cases, the entire E-waste treatment is being carried out in an unregulated environment in the informal sector, where there is no control on emissions (MoEF, 2008). The dominance of the informal sector can be explained by the toxic, yet efficient methods used in recycling (Skinner, 2010). Because of the important role of the refurbishment and resale market in India, only certain amount of E-waste were ultimately recycled (Skinner, 2010). 
		Based on the existing evidences informal recycling is the most pressing environmental issue associated with the E-waste (Williams et al., 2008). According to Chatterjee (2012), 95%of the E-waste in India is being recycled in non-formal sector and 5% of the E-waste volume is handled in formal unit. The authorized E-waste recycling facilities in India capture only 3% of total E-waste generated; the rest makes its way to informal recycling yards in major cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore (Greenpeace, 2008). This is because businesses sell their discarded IT and other equipment to informal recyclers for quick money without realizing the hazardous implications it causes to health and environment. Currently, in India, there are over 2000 units engaged in nonformal sector for E-waste recycling (Chatterjee, 2012). Such Non-formal units of E-waste recyclers are distributed almost all over India especially in states like in Delhi, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, West Bengal etc.
		There are well-established networks of waste collectors/dealers, dismantlers, and recyclers in India, most of which belong to the informal sector. Each such unit operates in a small scale, as for example in the form of door-to-door waste collectors/dealers, known locally as “kawariwalas” (Manomaivibool, 2009). Non-formal units generally follow the steps such as collection of the E-waste from the rag pickers, disassembly of the products for their useable parts, components, modules, which are having resell value. The rest of the material is chemically treated to recover precious metals causing leaching of hazardous substances to the air, soil, and water. Such recycling method has low efficiency and recovery is carried out only for valuable metals like gold, silver, aluminium, copper etc and other materials such as tantalum, cadmium, zinc, palladium etc. could not be recovered.

	<h1 id="a5"> Impacts of the Informal recycling activities of E-waste in India </h1>
	<p>
		1.	Social and Economic Impacts
		Today the EEEs have become parts and parcel of everyday life, not only in the urban areas, but also of some of the remotest areas of the world. People, especially the ones working in the urban areas, cannot imagine their lives without some of the EEEs like computers, televisions, mobile phones etc. Moreover these equipments play crucial role in the social and economic development of any community and country. As for example, nobody, today, could imagine of running and developing modern businesses, effectively and efficiently, without the help of EEEs. An entire sector like IT industries has grown with the input and support of information and telecommunication equipments. In today’s world, name any sector and EEEs are very much a part of the same. In the field of education, from kindergarten till university education, the use of EEEs, especially in the form of computers, is observed. Banking sector, these days, depends heavily on internet and mobile banking.
		Customers in the sector are encouraged to shift to internet and mobile banking which is mostly convenient and less time consuming. Willingly or unwillingly, people, now-a-days, have to depend on EEEs to certain extent. 
		But due to the social and economic disparity in the developing countries like India compared with their counter parts in developed countries many people lacks the use of the new EEE (Wath et al., 2010). The considerable price difference between the new and used EEE makes the consumer to go for the purchase of the second hand EEE in developing countries like India. The demand for second hand EEEs in India is quite high. Unscrupulous organisations in rich countries use donations of obsolete electronic equipment as a loop-hole in the Basel Convention to export both functioning and non-functioning electronic equipment to countries such as India (Ladou and Lovegrove, 2008). Owing to the high demand for second hand EEEs and low initial investment required for starting a collection, dismantling, sorting, or a recovery facility (Sinha, 2004), the E-waste recycling business has become very attractive for small entrepreneurs. For E-waste recycling facility owners in India, rather than creating environmental or social awareness, the financial profit is the main incentive in India (Wath et al., 2010). This is the reason that many urban poors are involved in the E-waste recycling business. These people have least knowledge on the harmful effects of improper E-waste recycling on their health and environment. The involvement of women and children in the recycling activities further exaggerate the problem related to E-waste management.

		2.	Occupational Health and Environmental Impacts
		In the context of India, the E-waste recycling businesses pose serious threats to the worker’s health and the environment. Various studies have shown that not only the health of the workers carrying out the recycling business is affected, but also the people residing in the vicinity of the E-waste recycling sites are adversely affected. A major problem in India is that as most of the people involved in the recycling business are illiterate and poor, they are totally unaware of the threats to their health and the environment as a whole from E-waste recycling operations. Such recycling areas are potential sites for uncontrolled air, water and soil pollution. However, such pollutions are neither quantified nor monitored. Wath et al. (2010) concludes that the whole E-waste management system in India is labour intensive and most of the recycling and recovery operations are carried out using outdated technologies and processes, which may lead to release of uncontrolled emission of pollutants.
		Tsydenova and Bengtsson (2011) carried out a detail study on the chemical hazards associated with E-waste treatment. The study reveals that the unregulated recycling activities generate workplace and environmental contamination by a wide range of chemicals. The authors point out that the rudimentary recycling techniques coupled with the amounts of E-waste processed have already resulted in adverse environmental and human health impacts in countries like China and India. As for example, in these countries metals from the E-waste are dissolved in strong acid solutions and subsequently recovered from the solutions. Similarly, plastic is manually removed from E-waste and mechanically shredded.
		Moreover, open burning of unwanted scrap and wastes is also a common practice everywhere in these countries. Such practices are carried out without any health and safety measures for the workers. Moreover, the workers and local residents are exposed to the chemicals through inhalation, dust ingestion, dermal exposure, and dietary intake.
